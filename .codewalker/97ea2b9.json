      "reasoning": "Improve GitHub token configuration instructions in the UI. Users were confused about whether to enter their token in the UI when it's already in .env.local. The updated help text clarifies that leaving the field blank will use the server-side token, and reminds users that private repositories require the 'repo' scope on their token.",
