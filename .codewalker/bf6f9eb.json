      "reasoning": "Create API endpoint to fetch repositories for authenticated users. The /api/github/repos route uses Octokit to list all repositories the user has access to, sorted by most recently updated. This enables automatic repository discovery instead of requiring manual entry.",

      "reasoning": "Build repository selector component with search and filtering. RepoSelector displays all user repositories in a searchable list, showing key metadata like privacy status, language, description, and last update date. Users can search by name or description, and toggle back to manual entry if needed. This improves UX by eliminating typos and showing available options.",

    {
      "reasoning": "Integrate repository selector into main page flow. Updates the configuration screen to show RepoSelector by default, with the ability to toggle to manual entry. The RepoSelector automatically uses the token from .env.local, and clicking a repo immediately configures the app. This creates a smoother onboarding experience.",
