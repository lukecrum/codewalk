      "reasoning": "Add tracking metadata support to DiffViewer component. Added a TrackingInfo type and optional tracking prop that allows passing commit reasoning, SHA, and message. The tracking info is injected into the DOM directly after the diff2html file header, using inline styles to match the existing design.",

    {
      "reasoning": "Simplify PRDiffViewer by removing the custom file header and tracking section. Instead of rendering these separately, pass the tracking data to the DiffViewer component which now handles displaying it below the diff2html header. This eliminates the redundant file path display and positions the metadata directly under the native diff header.",
