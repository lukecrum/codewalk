    {
      "reasoning": "Remove manual repository entry functionality. With GitHub OAuth, users can only access their own repos, so manual entry is no longer needed. Simplifies the RepoSelector props and removes the unused form from the home page.",

    {
      "reasoning": "Create a polished landing page for signed-out users. Includes a hero section with clear value proposition, three feature cards highlighting key capabilities (reasoning view, PR integration, commit detail), and a 'how it works' section with numbered steps.",

      "reasoning": "Improve the authenticated user experience with better visual hierarchy. Adds a clear heading and description above the repo selector card, and adds chevron indicators to repo list items for better affordance.",
