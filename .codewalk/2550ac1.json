      "reasoning": "Fix sticky headers appearing at wrong positions. The position calculations weren't accounting for marginTop on reasoning boxes (all except the first have marginTop: 1). Each subsequent reasoning block's header would stick further down than intended because the cumulative margin was missing from contentOffset.",

    {
      "reasoning": "Remove stale reasoningPaddingTop adjustment that caused headers to be cut off at the top and created gaps. The code was subtracting 1 from positions based on old paddingTop logic that no longer exists, causing misalignment between reasoning headers and file headers below them.",
