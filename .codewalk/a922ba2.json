      "reasoning": "Install diff2html package for beautiful diff rendering. This library provides professional-looking side-by-side diffs with syntax highlighting, replacing our basic plain text implementation. Chose diff2html because it's framework-agnostic and works well with React 19.",

      "reasoning": "Create DiffViewer component that wraps diff2html. This component takes a unified diff string and filename, then renders it using diff2html's side-by-side view. The component imports the CSS styles and handles the diff format conversion that diff2html expects (with file headers).",

      "reasoning": "Replace manual diff rendering with DiffViewer in TrackingVisualizer. Removes the line-by-line rendering code that manually colored additions/deletions and replaced it with DiffViewer calls. This applies to both the tracked changes view (where specific hunks are shown) and the fallback view (showing all changes when no tracking file exists). Reconstructs diff format by joining hunk headers and content.",
