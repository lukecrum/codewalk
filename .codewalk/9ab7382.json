    {
      "reasoning": "Reorganize TrackingVisualizer to use reasoning as the main organizational unit. Changed from grouping by file to grouping by logical change/reasoning. Each reasoning block now displays all files that were modified to accomplish that specific goal. Files can appear multiple times if they were modified for different reasons.",
      "files": [
        {
          "path": "components/TrackingVisualizer.tsx",
          "hunks": [1]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "reasoning": "Remove unused tracking injection logic from DiffViewer. Cleaned up the component by removing the inline reasoning injection code and debug console.logs, since we now handle reasoning display at a higher level in the parent components.",

    {
      "reasoning": "Update PRDiffViewer to match the new reasoning-first structure. Added logic to group file changes by reasoning instead of showing files first. Includes commit SHA and message with each reasoning block. Falls back to file-based display when no tracking data exists.",
